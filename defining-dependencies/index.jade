        section
          h2 Use requirements.txt
          ol
            li Install your packages as needed during development
              pre
                code pip install awesome-print  # or some other awesome package
            li Save periodic snapshots of the current environment
              pre
                code pip freeze > requirements.txt
              | For our Windows friends:
              pre
                code pip freeze | Out-File requirements.txt
            li Install previously recorded requirements
              pre
                code pip install -r requirements.txt

        section
          h2 Use setup.py
          p Ideal for reusable libraries or installable tools
          pre
            code
            | setup(
            |     name='coolpackage',
            |     version='0.1.0',
            |     author='Yours Truly',
            |     author_email='yt@example.com',
            |     packages=find_packages(),
            |     description='Your cool package.',
            |     install_requires=[
            |         'awesome-print',
            |         'requests>=2,<3',
            |     ],
            | )
          p Loose package requirements, better for being combined with other packages in the same environment.

        section
          h2 setup.py vs requirements.txt
          p
            b tl;dr
            | Just use requirements.txt
          ul
            li When it matters, and you've decided to make your package public, the dependencies will need to be reviewed anyway.
            li They are #[em not] the same, don't load requirements.txt somehow into setup.py.
